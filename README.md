# Cloud-Resume-Challenge

 I took on the challenge of creating a serverless resume website.

Here's what I did:
- Bought a domain on AWS ROUTE53.
- Built the project in AWS.
- Created CICDs for it.

Stack I used:
- Route 53 for name resolution.
- Certificate Manager for SSL.
- Cloudfront for faster loading.
- S3 for static hosting


Stacks I'm working on:
- Cloudformation for resources.
- API gateway to create apis.
- Lambda for Get & Post requests.
- DynamoDB for storing count.
